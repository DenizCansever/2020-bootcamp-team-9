# Composite Pattern

The composite design pattern belongs to the structural group and is to regulate the hierarchical use of object patterns in the tree structure. According to dofactory.com, the frequency of use is around 80%, so it is an important pattern that is used frequently. It is a design pattern that creates the parts that make up the structure in the community of objects that make up a structure according to the hierarchical structure of the tree and provides order for the relations between them.

## Composite Design Pattern Application
Composite pattern organizes hierarchies. As an example of this hierarchy, we considered course catalogs and course hierarchy. At the top are the course catalogs. Then, again, course catalogs or lessons can be found under it. This ranking goes all the way to the bottom lessons.
